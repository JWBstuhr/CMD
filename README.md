# CMD
CMD+ for ComputerCraft. Looking to improve some command functionality and make it usable on CC devices.

Built in CC: Tweaked, and also v1.89.2 for 1.12.2, so if it doesn't work on any other versions that's why.

### Installing
CMD+ uses modems, so you'll need one, preferably an Ender Modem. It would also be best placed in Spawn Chunks.

Depending on your setup, you'll either get the Advanced Computer one or Command Computer one.
Advanced Computers require a command block to be placed on one side.

The client is needed to run the commands. This is so you can have it on Pocket Computers.

Advanced CPU:
`wget [LINK MISSING]`

Command CPU:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JWBstuhr/CMD/main/Command%20Computer/cmdplus-term.lua`

Client:
`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JWBstuhr/CMD/main/cmdplus.lua`

### Usage
Just like normal commands, but instead of '/' you prefix with the file name or its prefix 'cmd'.

Time command has more inbuilt times (noon, etc) (for pre-1.13) and can also be used with just 't' instead of 'time'.

Weather command also has an alias of 'w', supporting 'r', 't', and 'c' as shortcuts for 'rain', 'thunder', and 'clear' respectively.
